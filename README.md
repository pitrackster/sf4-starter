## Install

> Of course you need to install docker-ce and docker-compose

- clone this repository
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `docker-compose exec web /bin/bash`
- `chown -R www-data:www-data var/log var/cache`
- `make init`
- go to `localhost:8080` and start coding !

## Useful docker commands

- `docker images` view all images and their size
- `docker-compose config` shows the detail of each service and values from .env file

## Usefull commands

- `php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`
- `composer clear-cache`
- there is a `Makefile` inside application folder that contains a lot of useful commands... read it !

## Good to know

- Every time you want to install some dependencies (npm | composer) do it from inside the container
- Every time you want to launch a symfony command, do it from inside the container
- In fact the only things you want to do outside containers is editing the code and updating project files...
- Js Translations are loaded via an ajax call ... So you wont be able to use js translations at page loading (but why would we want to do that ?)
